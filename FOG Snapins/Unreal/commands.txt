& '.\1 EpicInstaller-15.7.0.msi' /quiet
installs quietly



so far
CSCI-LW844-D5 has install

Unreal engine:
C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.2
size: 59.2GB, 235,015 files

currently compressing to lw844-d5\$c\temp
maybe leave there, or put in c:\program\Epic Games\ as well.



process:
robocopy first:
robocopy \\CSCI-LW844-D5\c$\Temp\UnrealPackage "C:\Program Files\Epic Games" /E /Z /ZB /R:5 /W:5 /TBD /NP /V /MT:16 UE_5.2.7z

unzip in that directory (-y = assumes yes to all prompts/user interaction):
& "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.2.7z" -r -o"C:\Program Files\Epic Games\" -y | Out-Null

delete the old 7z 
Remove-Item -Path "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.7.7z" -Force

Run Epic Games Launcher (Install Prerequisites and Downloads Updates) 
MsiExec.exe /i EpicInstaller-15.7.0.msi SHOULD_RUN_LAUNCHER=1 /qn

above works if in the SAME folder,which the snap-in should be.
IF need, location is: C:\Program Files (x86)\FOG\tmp\UnrealPackage\EpicInstaller-15.7.0


Epic Games Folder (PFx86EpicGames.7z). Will copy DirectXRedist and Launcher folder to Epic Games folder. overwrite but make sure disabled first  


close epic games task first:
Stop-Process -ProcessName EpicGamesLauncher

then:
& "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x .\PFx86EpicGames.7z -o"C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\" -r -y


Copy the manifests files (check if makes directory properly)
& "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x .\Manifests.7z -o"C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests" -r -y


Move BuildPatchServicesLocal
Move-Item -Path .\BuildPatchServicesLocal.ini -Destination "C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\"


Run Registry (UnrealProjectFile)
reg import .\UnrealProjectFile.reg


other files needed:

C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests"

C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"
C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\Launcher\Engine



11. Use 7-Zip with Fastest setting to save the entire contents of the Epic Games\Launcher folder.

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\Launcher" (354MB)

In addition to the Launcher folder package DirectXRedist folder

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\DirectXRedist"

12. Use 7-zip with Fastest setting to save the entire contents of the Unreal Engine folder (C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.22)

13. Use 7-zip with Fastest setting to save the entire contents of the Fortnite folder (C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Fortnite)

14. Go to the Epic Games Launcher Manifest folder (C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher\Data\Manifests) and copy the .manifest file/s.

(MANIFESTS folder won't exists inside of data on a new pc.. robocopy should take care of.. or mkdir first)


8D15BA6D4F8AFBD105F39892F57AA4D5.manifest <-- UnrealEngine 4.22

5375E9A749E92FF0764AC4B4957B7291.manifest <-- Fortnite 8.20

I recommend renaming the .manifest file to .unrealengine.<version>.manifest

Note, Epic Games Launcher recognises the renamed file but strips the additional information from the filename.

19. Go to the "C:\ProgramData\Epic\EpicGamesLauncher" folder and copy the "BuildPatchServicesLocal.ini" file.

The BuildPatchServices.ini file tells Epic Games Launcher whether or not prerequisites have been installed.


20. Export the file associations for Unreal Projects from the registry. Export the following key/s to a .REG file:

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Unreal.ProjectFile]

If the file associations for Unreal Project files are missing the launcher will attempt to create them on first run triggering a UAC prompt.

18. Make a note of the Windows Firewall Exceptions required for Epic Games Launcher and the Unreal Engine Editor eg:

"Epic Games Launcher x86","C:\program files (x86)\epic games\launcher\portal\binaries\win32\epicgameslauncher.exe"

"Epic Games Launcher x64","C:\program files (x86)\epic games\launcher\portal\binaries\win64\epicgameslauncher.exe"

"Unreal Engine 4.21 Editor x86","C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.21\Engine\Binaries\Win32\UE4Editor.exe"

"Unreal Engine 4.21 Editor x64","C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.21\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe"

"Fortnite x64","C:\program files\epic games\fortnite\fortnitegame\binaries\win64\fortniteclient-win64-shipping.exe"

"Fortnite x86","C:\program files\epic games\fortnite\fortnitegame\binaries\win32\fortniteclient-win32-shipping.exe"

You should now have all the source files required for installing the Epic Games Launcher and Unreal Engine:

EpicInstaller-9.7.0.msi <-- Epic Installer downloaded from the Epic Games website

DirectXRedist.7z <-- 7-zip file containing DirectXRedist folder

Launcher_971.7z <-- 7-zip file containing Epic Games Launcher folder

Unreal.ProjectFile.Association.reg <-- File containing registry entries for Unreal project file

BuildPatchServicesLocal.ini <-- File registering prerequisites installation.

UE_4.22.7z <-- 7-zip file containing Unreal Engine 4.22

Fortnite_820.7z <-- 7-zip file containing Fortnite 8.20

8D15BA6D4F8AFBD105F39892F57AA4D5.UnrealEngine.4.22.manifest <-- UnrealEngine 4.22

5375E9A749E92FF0764AC4B4957B7291.Fortnite.8.20.manifest <-- Fortnite 8.20

I recommend creating separate packages for the Epic Games Launcher and Unreal Engine/Fortnite.
