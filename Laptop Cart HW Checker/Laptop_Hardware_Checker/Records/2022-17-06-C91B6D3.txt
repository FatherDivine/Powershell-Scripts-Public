"Technician Notes (Pre): Used by Natalie Kerston of Anschutz Campus since Nov 22,2021. The AC Adapter is cracked around the ent
ire end closest to the 3-prong cable, and will need a replacement at some point (or lots of electrical tape). Laptop has a scra
tch, but everything else seems good. These issues were reported by Natalie upon pickup (6-16-2022)."
