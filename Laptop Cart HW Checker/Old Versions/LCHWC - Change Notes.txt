LCHWC 1.5.5
----------------------------------------------
- Changed "Results.txt" to "Date-Serial#.txt" for record keeping of the date of the last comparison as well as to easily identify in a folder (eg: on \\data)
- Updated LCHWCMailer.ps1 to reflect looking for "Date-Serial#.txt" instead of "Results.txt". Involved passing 2 variables (date & serial#) to PowerShell.
- Added Feature: Copies the "Date-Serial#.txt" file to \\data\dept\CEAS\ITS\Labs\Laptop Cart Resources\Laptop_Check\Records
- Added Feature: Housekeeping Service. Deletes the LCHWC folder and its contents from cladmin desktop. As a copy is put on \\data and also emailed, there is no need for the other files unless a user wishes to compare the files manually. Thus a Y|N input was added to take input from the user. Y means cleanup, N keeps the LCHWC folder intact.


LCHWC 1.5
----------------------------------------------
- Fixed Technician notes not writing to file
- Fixed comparison not comparing files correctly (replaced findstr with FC)
- Removed Service Tag from PostHardware check for 2 reasons: To allow for the Service Tag to exist in the (emailed) Results.txt, as well as have a copy of the original Service Tag (a check that tells if the entire computer/mobo was replaced).


LCHWC 1.0
----------------------------------------------
- Added Laptop Monitor PNP Device ID to detect if LCD was exchanged (possibly broke/repaired)
- Added comparison check between 2 Hardware text files (to verify any changes other than the time)
- Adding ability to tell the difference in time between both files(which would give a good estimate of how long the laptop was checked out for)
- Possibly at the end of the script, making PostHardware.txt, PreHardware.txt, & Results.txt file themselves in a (timestamped) folder inside of LCHWC in the event the script needs to run again. If not timestamped, with a +1
- Added "rem :: " comments in code to narrate what the code does.
- Added serialnumber to memorychip wmic's 


LCHWC 0.5
----------------------------------------------
- Creation of script (pulling info using wmic commands)
- Added UAC escalation
- Added auto closing of command prompt after pause
- Added logic to check of LCHWC folder exists first, if not create
- Added logic to check if PreHardware.txt is empty, if not create & log to PostHardare.txt instead
- Added date & timestamp (was broke, fixed)
- Added Dell service tag (wmic)
- Made PreHardare.txt read-only

How-to guides – Problem-oriented, take the user through a series of steps to reach a real-world goal

Conversely, changelogs are comprehensive lists of the new features, enhancements, bugs, and other changes in reverse chronological order. Changelogs usually link to specific issues or feature requests within a change management system and also may include links to the developer who supplied the change.

README – A high-level overview of the software, usually alongside the source code

Add section for tech notes and how to use (one line, press enter to finish notes). notes on physical condition etc.

use current date-timestamp to save a copy on \\data. intresting in the field testing
