# Domain Trust Fix Tool
# Fixes the domain trust relationship locally.
# Used when logging into windows with university account
# and get an error like: "The trust relationship between 
# this workstation and the primary domain failed." 
# 
# Will add ability to do a list of computers soon.
# And of course, command-line parameter use.


If your computer already has PowerShell policy bypassed, you can right-click and run "DomainTrustFixTool.ps1". 
If not, it is best to run "RUN ME-StartScript.bat" which does all the work of allowing you to run
"DomainTrustFixTool.ps1".
