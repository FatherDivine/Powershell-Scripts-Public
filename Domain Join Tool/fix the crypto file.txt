I suspect your problem is because of the code you're using to encrypt the data.

FlushFinalBlock needs to be called on the encryptor or the encryptor created from the AesCryptoServiceProvider object needs to be explicitly Disposed when the encryption is finished. Preferably both.

Both the encryptor and decryptor need to use the same cryptographic padding. The current "best practice" is to use PKCS#7 when you create an AesCryptoServiceProvider by setting its Padding property to PaddingMode.PKCS7.

These are just assumptions at this poi
