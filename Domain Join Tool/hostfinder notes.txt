join domain
and joindomainFindHostname

Find hostname works with 

script finds hostname but can move to a function
Find hostname function: checks if hostname already exists. IF so, finds the next cantenation (++, +1) to the #. 

with hostname finder, can use as such:
get hostname, send to finder to see if exists, if so, finds the next available and gives back. (if cedc-test-1W exists, it will make it cedc-test-2W)

hostname exists, would you like to try and join with this host or find another hostname ? like $hostname+1 ?

can add hostname finder function after a failed attempt at joining. prob for best.
